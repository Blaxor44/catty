            The Scottish Fold can be traced back to a farm in the Tayside region of Scotland in 1961. 
            A shepherd named William Ross saw the cat, obtained a kitten, and developed the breed. 
            The Scottish Fold is distinguished by its flexible ears that fold downward and forward 
            providing the cat's face a teddy bear, owl, or pixie look that attracted many American cat lovers.
            The trademark folded ears are the result of a dominant gene that affects the cartilage in the cat's entire body. 
            The Scottish Fold generally presents a sad-looking appearance, 
            but their personality on the contrary is happy and energetic, and they enjoy socializing and love attention. 
            However, health can be an issue as this breed can be impacted by degenerative joint tissues.
