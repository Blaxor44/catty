    <p class="card-text">
      The Ashera can cost as much as a whopping $125,000 because it is an extremely rare breed. 
      A Los Angeles-based firm produces only 5 kittens of this type each year. 
      So if you buy one, you will be among the very few owners of this amazing cat breed. 
      In aesthetics, the Ashera resembles a snow leopard in its pattern.
      But its behavior and temperament are similar to Savannah cats. 
      In fact, some experts argue that genetic testing reveals that Ashera cats are nothing but Savannah F1 cats.
      This exotic breed is a hybrid of the Asian leopard cat, a domestic housecat, and the African serval. 
      Personality-wise, it is loyal, affectionate, and very intelligent. 
      Despite the controversy about its genetics, the Ashera is the most prized pet cat in the world and you can take one home 
      if you can cough up the astronomical price.
