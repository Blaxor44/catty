            A hybrid of the wild African serval cat and a domestic Persian cat, the first Savannah was produced in 1986 
            by Bengal breeder Judee Frank. This breed soon became popular and was accepted by breeder associations 
            in the mid 1990s. Like dogs, Savannah cats are extremely loyal. 
            They are open to socializing with other pets and strangers if trained at an early age. 
            Savannahs that are not used to strangers start growling and hissing. 
            These cats are strong and agile and can easily jump onto high cabinets, refrigerators, and door tops. 
            In addition, they are smart, curious, playful, and active, and need plenty of exercise.
            Savannahs can be classified into five types from F1 TO F5. 
            F1 cats are around 50% serval, while F5 cats are about 11% serval. 
            The price of this breed depends on their gender and classification and a prize F1 female can command up to $50,000.
