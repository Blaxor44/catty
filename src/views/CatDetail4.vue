            Many reports trace back the Persian cats to 19th century Persia (modern day Iran), 
            but historical evidence suggests that the breed has been existing since hundreds of years before Christ. 
            They are noted for their open pansy-like faces and luxurious long hair. 
            In addition, they have a gentle and sweet personality and can easily adapt to a noisy household. 
            Persian cats are playful by nature and their expressive eyes provide them a cute and delightful look. 
            However, you need to be intricate and thorough in their maintenance 
            as their long coat is vulnerable to hairballs and tangles.
            The Persian cat is widely recognized by its mushy face and fluffy hair. 
            It enjoys showing affection and cuddling, but is not very vocal. 
            Their furry coat needs daily grooming and brushing. This breed comes in multiple variations and colors. 
            Its weight is comparable to a regular American Shorthair.
