            An elegant Russian breed, the Peterbald cat can be hairless or have a coat that resembles a peach. 
            Some cats of this breed may have a velvety coat, while others have hair that looks like a man's bristly beard. 
            The first documented Peterbald was in 1988 when reports revealed a cat with an unusual coat in Russia. 
            After that, Peterbalds were exported to other countries in Europe. 
            These cats make delightful pets and are known for their muscular build.
            The first Peterbald was obtained from mating between a Russian Donskoy and an Oriental Shorthair. 
            Similar to the Donskoy cat, the Peterbald has a dominant gene which makes it hairless. 
            It is a smart and affectionate cat, and will rest peacefully on your lap. 
            However, its skin is very sensitive so children need to handle it carefully. 
            In addition, this breed is susceptible to sunburn and hence cannot spend a long time outdoors.
